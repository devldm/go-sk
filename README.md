# GO-SK Job Board

I am looking for a role in korea so i started a side-project with the aim of helping others find jobs too.

## Aim
create a place where companies can host job postings and users can find roles.

## Outcome
This was fully finished in an MVP state as it allowed for posting jobs, viewing roles and applying (link out to an external posting)

## Current state
This project currently still functions and has a test role in place to show its functionality. I'd like to return to it when i get time to polish its styling and add features

## App Repo
You can find the app version [here](https://www.github.com/devldm/go-sk-app)
