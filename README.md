# GO-SK Job Board

I am looking for a role in korea so i started a side-project with the aim of helping others find jobs too. It was important to me that this was a modern and responsive web app which would allow for a smoother UX than more traditional job boards.

## Aim

Create a place where companies can host job postings and users can find roles.

## How to access

This website it hosted here:

 [https://go-sk.vercel.app/](https://go-sk.vercel.app/)

## Tech choices

### Front end

- Next.js / React
- tailwindcss
- typescript

### Back end

- Prisma
- supabase

#### Why these?

**Next.js** -  Provides some great quality of life improvements over base react. I recently migrated this repository from Next.js v12 to v14 and it now leverages Sever Actions and is built using the App router.

**tailwindcss** - Allows us to create great looking and responsive websites while providing a great UX.

**typescript** - Allows us to create a strongly typed codebase and provides great tooling to developers for more robust and testable applications.

**prisma** - Along with TS in the front end Prisma offers a great way to make our application type safe on the back end too. It provides us an easy to implement schema for our database and makes it simple to query and update data.

**supabase** - I believe supabase offers the best UX for devs building fully functioned and scale-able backends. Giving us actions to a database, edge functions, auth and much more.
